JupyterLab is the newest update to Jupyter Notebook, the Python-based web
application.

The classic Jupyter Notebook offers a number of different building blocks for
interactive computing: the notebook, file browser, text editor, terminal,
outputs, etc. We view JupyterLab as the evolution of the classic notebook, as it
allows a more flexible and powerful way for working with those same building
blocks.

JupyterLab offers a file explorer to open existing notebooks, create new
notebooks, and organize your content. JupyterLab's file explorer is on the left
pane of the main view.

You may notice that Jupyter has a concept of 'windows' and 'tabs', unlike the
classic Jupyter Notebook experience. This is a very powerful feature of
JupyterLab: you can stack notebooks, place notebooks side by side, organize
notebooks by tabs, etc.

Similar to the windows and tabs above, JupyterLab allows users to move cells in
a notebook by dragging and dropping them. JupyterLab also supports dragging
cells from one notebook to another notebook. Simply click the area to the left
of the cell you want to move, and drag it wherever ..
